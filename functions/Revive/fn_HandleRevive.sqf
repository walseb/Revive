Changing it from "playmove" to "switch move" fixes that issue. It does make the revive animation look a bit more janky since it snap switches instead of transitions but is worth the tradeoff in order for the player to appear dead outside of a vehicle which I believe is more important than the rolling animation.  This could be fixed if Bohemia fixes the bug with the "AinjPpneMstpSnonWnonDnon" animation and I would be able to keep the rolling on stomach animation.
